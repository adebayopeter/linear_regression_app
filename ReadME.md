## Description
This project provides an API and a Streamlit application for predicting power output (PE) based on environmental factors. The model uses Linear Regression from Scikit-Learn, trained on features including:

- Ambient Temperature (AT)
- Exhaust Vacuum (V)
- Ambient Pressure (AP)
- Relative Humidity (RH)

The API is deployed using FastAPI, and a Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to input values and get predictions.

# Requirements
To set up and run this project, you’ll need the following Python packages:

- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `joblib`
- `numpy`
- `streamlit`

You can install these dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

1. Train and Save Model

    Train a Linear Regression modeling using scikit-learn, and save the trained model to a file for deployment:
    ```bash
    python linear_regression_model.py
    ```
